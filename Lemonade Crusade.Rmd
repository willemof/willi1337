## Hi-ho!

Alrighty, so not all of us are up to speed with RStudio, Rmarkdown, Github, etc etc. Thats ok!


# Operating-Systems

So I think we have two people on MacOS, and four people on windows. Sorry Mac users, I personally have very little experience with how things work so I will only be able to speak from my experience as a windows-user. 

# Download Git

To be honest... I'm not sure if the class explained the material all that well. I think a better approach would be to download Git before doing anything in RStudios. So basically get Git, do all the installations, etc, etc, until you get the program which is basically a command-prompt.

# Download R, and Rstudio

Again, somehow you gotta download and install R and R studio. Then, when you open Rstudio, you can open a "new project" open through Git post it into whatever repository in Github that you want the project to be synced to. From there your directory will have a Github folder with whatever name you names your project with some automatically generated R files, like .gitignore, .Rhistory, yourproject.Rproj, a README.md, if you enabled that on your Github repository. 

# Making pdfs

This wasn't covered in class, but basically you can make LaTeX-documents in RStudios if you download the right package.

Run the following lines in your console:
> **install.packages("tinytex")**

> **tinytex::install_tinytex()**

This will install tinytex, which will enable you to knit your markdown as a pdf.

##The Assignments

> We are instructed to arrange a lemonade sale to finance for a trip.

Gonna skip the whole motivation/schmotivation spiel, because I would spend too much time on something that isn't directly relevant for the assignment.

>**The estimated price to travel is $300**

>Time for business

##Lemonade sales
```{r}
prices <- c(30,40,10,20)
print(prices)
```

>sum of prices:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sum(prices)
```

>names of lemonade:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
names <- c("chunky delight", "The big one", "One shotter", "Fresh Squeeze")

library(tidyverse)

lemon_menu<- tibble(prices, names)

lemon_menu
```

>I like the chunky delight, which is the first row, costs 30. (Pretty expensive lemonade)
